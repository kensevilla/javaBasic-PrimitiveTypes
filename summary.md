**should_perform_logical_boolean_operations**
1. the diferrence between &, |, || and &&. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7199666/difference-between-and-in-java
2. first I do not know the difference between the operators so I kind of guessed. but then I learned that when with boolean the behavior of bitwise is actually similar to the logical operators
3. I used basic logical operator knowledge, since it's only boolean, then I figure that it is similar. 
4. None

**should_do_bitwise_not_operation**
1. how ~ works. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operators-in-java/
2. I do not know how ~ works, but since the expected variable at first is 0. then it should not be similar with the actual value
3. ~ will just inverse the binary conversion of the value. meaning it will convert the value to binary and returns the compliment representation in this case, -65536.
4. None

**should_describe_escaped_chars**
1. how escaping character can be understood by java. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1367322/what-are-all-the-escape-characters
2. first I tried actually input the literal values but it is encountering an error because some are not seen as character.
3. based on the method name I figure that I should use escape characters to satisfy the expected output
4. None

**should_not_get_rounded_result_if_convert_floating_number_to_integer**
1. how casting float to int can automatically convert the value into integer. https://www.java67.com/2015/10/how-to-convert-float-to-int-in-java-example.html
2. since the first value of variable expected is Integer.MAX_VALUE
3. based on my knowledge, casting a float to int will just remove the decimal places of the value and will just make it a whole number so I just set the value to 2
4. None
